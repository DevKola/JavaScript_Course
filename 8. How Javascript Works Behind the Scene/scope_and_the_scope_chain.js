  //Scope/Scoping Concepts:
    This is how our program's varibales are organized and accessed. Where do variables live and where can we access certain variable and where not?
    Thers is something called lexical scoping: 
      This is simply how variables are organized is entirely controlled by placement of functions and blocks in the code. i.e a function written inside another function has access to the variable in the parent function.

  //What is a Scope?
    This is the space or environment in which a certain variable is declared (variable environment in case of functions). There is global scope, function scope, and block scope.

  //Scope of variable:
    This the region of our code, where a certain variable can be accessed.

  The 3 types of scope in JS: Global, function and block scope.
    1. Global scope:
      Variables declared outside any function. These are variables that can be accessed anywhere in the code
    2. Function Scope: 
      These are local scope which can only be accessed inside the function and not anywhere else.
    3. Block scope:
      Variables accessible only inside block like the if statement of the for loop
